        <p> The small balcony near my grandmother's room is the result of my favorite hobby, gardening. I think, it is the best of all the hobbies which one can follow with a lot of amusement and benefit to health. My grandmother told me how to farm. Plant the seeds in their season give them water,air and sunlight and they grow for you. And we also have to harvest the fruit's if a fruit tree. Agriculture is very important. This is because they give us food,oxygen,wood and natural fibres. All parts of the cocunut tree are used by living beings. They also have some unsual ways to help out nature like controling the insect population by eating or keeping insects out.</p>
